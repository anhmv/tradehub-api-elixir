# Elixir API Wrapper for Tradehub

## Summary

#### Title: Elixir API Wrapper for Tradehub

#### Description:

- This project aims to viral the Tradehub blockchain into the world of Elixir/Erlang developers community, who are building
games, trading bots, or signals alert by providing a tool that can be easy to interact with the Tradehub blockchain.

- Also, inspiring of the book [Create a cryptocurrency trading bot in Elixir](https://www.elixircryptobot.com/), that
has been showing the best guide ever to create a crypto bot for Binance from scratch, using Elixir with its powerful technology
OTP (Open Telecom Platform)

## Details

- Providing features that compatible with the work of the Python wrapper API and the Node wrapper API.
- Elixir/Erlang developers can interact with the Tradehub blockchain without any additional steps.

- The project owner commits to manage the package 2 years after the launch.
- After 2 years of maintenance, depends on the demand of the usage, the owner will decide to continue to maintain or not.
- Maintenance or feature requests can be accomplished by creating issues, and pull requests.

## Risks and Benefits

#### Discuss the potential drawbacks of your project and any mitigations

- Dependencies are using on the project may contain a trojan/backdoor to steal your private keys.
It is no different from the risks involved with Javascript and Python projects but should be noted.

- Since the project is hosted by Github, it has an assistant bot to inform the owner which dependencies are safe to use and keep them up-to-date.

#### Discuss any auxiliary benefits that may arise from implementing the project

Elixir/Erlang and its powerful concurrency technology OTP(Open Telecom Platform) exists over decades and has many
successful projects like games, message brokers, banking, or projects that need low-latency and fault-tolerance.

I believe this project will viral the Tradehub blockchain to Elixir developers, as well as added liquidity to
DEMEX pairs.

Also, this is the first step of integrating the DEMEX into a trading platform, such as [Tai](https://github.com/fremantle-industries/tai)

## Project Roadmap and Key Deliverables

#### Define a realistic timeline and roadmap for your project

- Deliverable 1 (End of May): Finalize coding the package

The target of this deliverable is to allow developers to connect to public, private, and WebSocket endpoints.

- Deliverable 2 (End of June): Automate unit testing and bugs fixing

This deliverable ensures that the package runs smoothly without coding mistakes.

- Deliverable 3 (Mid July): House cleaning and documentation

The final deliverable makes sure the dependencies are safe to use, gets rid of unused dependencies and unnecessary code.
Finalize documentation.

- Other

This section does not a deliverable, it is a plan to viral the package to the developers' community by writing step-by-step
guidelines/series, it helps to attract people. I am planning to write an article for each month.

## Budget

#### Total budget required for the project: 150000 SWTH

#### Budget breakdown:

* Deliverable 1: 50%
* Deliverable 2: 30%
* Deliverable 3: 20%
