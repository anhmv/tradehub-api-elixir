# Tradehub

Welcome to the Tradehub API Elixir project. The goal of this project is to empower other developers and end users by offering a Elixir client that is able to interact with all aspects of the Tradehub blockchain and DEMEX decentralized exchange via its REST/WS endpoints.

**NOTE**: This module is under development and may change drastically from each update. It is recommended to develop on Testnet first.
